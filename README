* Semester: Spring 2020

## Overview

This Java project you will implement a Java program that models a deterministic finite automaton.


## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac fa.nfa.NFADriver
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java fa.nfa.NFADriver ./tests/[testfiles]

Testfiles:
p2tc1.txt
p2tc2.txt
p2tc3.txt
```

## Discussion
For this project, we had a good start communicating with teammates. We 
made a group chat and everyone was quick responding to the chat answering 
any troubles, or questions.
We walked throw the project and methods to make sure everyone understand
what methods we need to create, and what methods we could bring from the 
last DFA project. After that we assigned ourselves to methods we have to 
complete.  We had a difficulty working on getDFA() methods that return a 
DFA identical to the current NFA. We spent time figuring out what we need 
and how to form the methods correctly.
