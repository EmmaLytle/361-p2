* Semester: Spring 2020

## Overview

This Java project you will implement a Java program that models a deterministic finite automaton.


## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac fa.nfa.NFADriver
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java fa.nfa.NFADriver ./tests/[testfiles]

Testfiles:
p2tc1.txt
p2tc2.txt
p2tc3.txt
```

## Discussion
We implimented some of the methods exactly we did in DFA. For this project, we had a good start 
communicating with teamates. We walked throw the project and methods to make sure everyone understand
what methods we need to create, and what methods we could bring from the last DFA project. After 
that we assigned ourselves to methods we have to complete. 
We had a difficulty working on getDFA() methods that returns a DFA identical to the 
current NFA. We spent time figuring out what we need and how to form the methods.
